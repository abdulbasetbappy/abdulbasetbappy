# Hi there! 👋 I'm Abdul Baset Bappy

Hello! I make web applications using the MERN stack, which means I use MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js to build things on the internet. I love turning ideas into websites!

## 🌟 What I'm Up To
- **Building Cool Websites**: I've created 12 websites so far. Each one taught me something new!
- **Solving Problems**: Whenever there's a bug or issue in a web app, I'm the detective. I've fixed issues in all the projects I've worked on.
- **Team Player**: I work well with others. Recently, I partnered with a Senior Developer on a big web project.
- **Learning**: The tech world is always changing, and I'm always learning. Right now, I'm diving deeper into React.js.

## 🛠 Tools I Use
- Languages: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- Frameworks: Node.js, React.js, Express.js
